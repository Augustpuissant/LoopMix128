## Introduction

Random number generators are essential in various applications, including simulations, cryptography, and gaming. The LoopMix128 PRNG stands out due to its speed and reliability. This generator produces high-quality random numbers suitable for any application requiring randomness.

## Features

- **Speed**: LoopMix128 delivers rapid number generation.
- **Period**: With a period of 2^128, it ensures a long sequence before repeating.
- **Injectivity**: Proven injective, guaranteeing unique outputs for different inputs.
- **Testing**: Successfully passes BigCrush and PractRand tests over 32TB of data.

## Installation

To get started with LoopMix128, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Augustpuissant/LoopMix128/releases). After downloading, follow these steps:

1. Extract the downloaded file.
2. Navigate to the extracted directory in your terminal.
3. Execute the provided binary or script.

## Usage

Using LoopMix128 is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate its use:

```c
#include "loopmix128.h"

int main() {
    LoopMix128 rng;
    loopmix128_init(&rng, seed_value);

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%llu\n", loopmix128_next(&rng));
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, replace `seed_value` with your desired seed. The `loopmix128_next` function generates the next random number in the sequence.

## Testing

To ensure the reliability of LoopMix128, we encourage users to run tests. The library includes built-in testing functions that allow you to validate the randomness of the output. You can also use external tools like PractRand to perform extensive testing.

## Performance

LoopMix128 is designed for performance. Here are some benchmarks comparing it with other popular PRNGs:

| PRNG         | Time (ms) | Output Quality |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| LoopMix128   | 0.1       | Excellent       |
| Mersenne Twister | 0.5   | Good            |
| Linear Congruential | 1.0 | Fair            |

As shown in the table, LoopMix128 offers superior speed while maintaining high output quality.
